get tables and change to sql format

create tables.

use .query execution in boto3.
genertes 2 file in txt and metadata 
output query file in txt format change that to sql format- rename to sql-make the extension in sql 
and change that location to 2nd parent folder to bbnn.sql
and delete that metadata 

create athena client
query text= show(create table transactions)...

my flow:

get the file out from s3 and read the contents and save it to sql format
delte the metadata file
move the save dfile to s3 in the tablename.sql format

correct flow:
for single file
rename the txt file alone and throw it to parent folder
have S3 commands in boto3

first get list of databses available, then go with files in each tables.
then do it for all the tables available
get athena sql statement for every table in the account
store it in sql
start query execution, get the output, Rename the output,
